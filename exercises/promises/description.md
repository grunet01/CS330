# JavaScript Promises

## Task

1. Work inside the _js_promises_ directory.
2. Create a proper directory structure (_css_ for CSS files, _js_ for JavaScript).
3. Create a page with a _number_ input field, a _button_, and a _checkbox_. When the button is clicked, read a number from the field and generate page content based on the data received from [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/).
4. You should include information about _3_ (three) numbers: the one entered by the user (_n_), one less than that (_n-1_), and one greater than that (_n+1_).
5. Information about each number must be enclosed in a `div` element with two more `div` elements inside it: the number itself and the trivia. Make sure to add the results to the existing `div` with the `id` of _number_info_.
6. If the _checkbox_ is checked, retrieve data in **one** batch request (notice the slight delay in the demo as information appears _without_ the batch option selected).
7. Use JavaScript Promises to send requests and parse the JSON response to generate HTML content.
8. Use Bootstrap and/or CSS to style your application.
